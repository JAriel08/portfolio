                                Hi, I am John Ariel Lalap and I am a Front-End Developer who specializes in HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and React. Also, I have some basic knowledge on Back-End technologies such as Node.js, Express, and MySQL. 
                            </span>
                            <span>I learned all this at the bootcamp I attended called "KodeGo". In 3 months of studying there, I developed my hard skills and soft skills by building real-world projects and by working with other people. </span><br/>

                            <span>Moreover, I have a goal of becoming a Full Stack Developer once I gain a lot of experience working in this industry. Also, I will keep on studying in order to reach it. </span><br/>
                            <span>
                                What are you waiting for? Letâ€™s make something special now!
